My portfolio page for Telling Stories with Data, Spring 2022

### *About Me*
Hi! I'm Delaney (she/her). 

I am a first-year Entertainment Industry Management student interested in market research, content development, and ultimately producing to tell stories that don't usually get to be told. Data is an important part of this - we need to understand data to know what content will work, what audiences want to see, and what will ultimately be successful in an increasingly digital entertainment world. I had a computer science minor in college, leading me to use a data-driven approach to content development.

### *What I Hope to Learn*
As someone who's been a graphic designer, I've always drawn things by hand - I really would love to learn how to create visualizations using data and Excel and other software to not have to draw so many graphs by hand on my iPad. I've been spending my entire education finding the overlap and balance between art and science, and more specifically media and progrmaming. This is just another very important step on that path!

### Assignment: Visualizing Govenrment Data
##### *Government Debt as % of GDP - Bar Chart* 

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6BjA" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6BjA" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020</a></iframe>

##### *Government Debt as % of GDP - Stacked Line Chart*
This visualization takes the Government Debt as percentage of GDP ratio of 45 countries around the world, spanning from 1995 to 2019. There are also graphs showing the average of these ratios at the bottom of the collection.

##### *Government Debt as % of GDP - Treemap!*
This visualization is very different from the previous two; it presents the data as more parts of a whole. Each country, with data from 1995 to 2019, is sized by their *count* - in this case, the overall sum of their Debt-to-GDP Ratio. Within each block of a country, the user can mouse over individual blocks of years to see the ratio of that year - the years are also sized by the size of the ratio. 

The benefits of this visualization, and why I chose the treemap for this third visualization of the same data, is that it puts the overall performance over 25 years of each country in comparison with each other. By simply looking at this graph, you can see that Japan has the overall greater Debt-to-GDP ratio. It's more about comparision as parts of a whole than the individual numbers (like the bar graph) or change over time (the stacked line charts). Each graph will have a different outcome for a different audience - this third one, the treemap, would be best for an audience trying to determine overall country performance in terms of debt over the past 25 years as a whole. The treemap almost visualizes total government debt of the world as one big piece, and each country takes a slice of that piece determined by the ratio of their debt to their GDP. It tells a whole story in just one look.
