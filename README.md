My portfolio page for Telling Stories with Data, Spring 2022

### *About Me*
Hi! I'm Delaney (she/her). 

I am a first-year Entertainment Industry Management student interested in market research, content development, and ultimately producing to tell stories that don't usually get to be told. Data is an important part of this - we need to understand data to know what content will work, what audiences want to see, and what will ultimately be successful in an increasingly digital entertainment world. I had a computer science minor in college, leading me to use a data-driven approach to content development.

### *What I Hope to Learn*
As someone who's been a graphic designer, I've always drawn things by hand - I really would love to learn how to create visualizations using data and Excel and other software to not have to draw so many graphs by hand on my iPad. I've been spending my entire education finding the overlap and balance between art and science, and more specifically media and progrmaming. This is just another very important step on that path!
