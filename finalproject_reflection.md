Not much has changed since this project began - I always had a pretty direct topic, it was just a matter of which parts of the story to tell. 

Some substantial changes happened since Part II:
  - I got rid of the Best Picture to Best Director ratio comparisons - it felt contrived, especially since for the past 15-ish years the Best Picture category has had twice as many nominees as that of Best Director. It felt like a tenuous connection to draw, and I didn't want my data to be misleading or misread by anyone in my audience. 
  - I added information about the Golden Globes, mostly to show that it's an industry-wide problem with awards shows
  - I altered the line graph charting the change in female director percentages over time to be more readable - and to reflect the greater conversation of Oscar nominations more! 


In terms of defining my audience, it really came down to how specific I wanted my call to action to be. Clearly my audience wouldn't have direct impact on the demographics of who was invited to be an Oscar voter, nor would they be producers choosing who is directing the year's top movies! But I also didn't want my audience to be so broad that the steps to take weren't as actionable, or didn't mean much to them. 

I decided, then, on a general population audience, but the subsect of the population who genuinely cares and keeps up with - at least a little bit - about the film industry. Not just the people working within it, but those who actively consume it and have a relatively positive relationship with it. 

For the actual creation of the site, my visualizations comprised mostly of Tableau and Canva. Using Canva to make a lot of these more simplistic visualizations I think make the presentation more visually appealing, as well as less daunting to the average viewer who still wants to learn more about this industry. 

Really, in the final week of this project, I wanted this presentation to be something that could easily be shared and distributed beyond this class - something that the average person could see and gain some insight from! And in my opinion, I was successful in that, and I'm proud of the final product.
