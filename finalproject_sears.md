# The Final Project Part I: Female Directors at the Oscars

### The Outline
In this project, I want to highlight the representation reflected in the Best Director award at the oscars - or, in more likely terms, the *lack* of representation. This will mainly focus on women, as with the 2022 Oscar nominations we got the FIRST woman to ever be nominated a SECOND TIME for a directing Oscar in Jane Campion, but it feels remiss to discuss this without acknowledging the incredibly racial disparity in the directing nominees as well. Yes, it's a story that has a lot of traction, but with the recent history made with Jane Campion, it feels important to tell now. 

In recent years, a greater recognition of gender and racial equality in Hollywood has been pushed. There was the #MeToo movement that loomed over the 2018 Oscars, and the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag that began in 2015 and is revived every so often when nominations are announced. And this is not to say strides have not been made - _Parasite_ won the big prizes in 2020, and films written and directed by women like _Promising Young Woman (2020)_ and _Little Women (2019)_ have been significantly nominated for Best Picture or Screenplay. 

When it comes to directors, however, change has not been as quick. **Only 7 women have been *nominated* for Best Director in the 94 years of the Academy Awards**. There have been 2 wins, the second happening only last year in 2020. 2020 was the first year in Oscar history that more than 1 woman was nominated in the Best Director category. 

Similarly, only **6 Black directors have been nominated in 94 years, none of them women, and none of them winning.** 

The exclusion of women from the Best Director category also has ties to those movies that win for Best Picture - of the 93 films that have won Best Picture, 67 have won Best Director as well. That's a 72% win relationship between director and Best Picture. Interestingly enough, **18** women-directed films have garnered a Best Picture nomination - with only **8** getting nominated (2 of those being Jane Campion), that ratio drops to 44%.
