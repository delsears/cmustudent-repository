### **The Outline**
In this project, I want to highlight the representation reflected in the Best Director award at the oscars - or, in more likely terms, the *lack* of representation. This will mainly focus on women, as with the 2022 Oscar nominations we got the FIRST woman to ever be nominated a SECOND TIME for a directing Oscar in Jane Campion, but it feels remiss to discuss this without acknowledging the incredibly racial disparity in the directing nominees as well.
