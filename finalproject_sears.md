# The Final Project Part I: Female Directors at the Oscars

### The Outline
In this project, I want to highlight the representation reflected in the Best Director award at the oscars - or, in more likely terms, the *lack* of representation. This will mainly focus on women, as with the 2022 Oscar nominations we got the FIRST woman to ever be nominated a SECOND TIME for a directing Oscar in Jane Campion, but it feels remiss to discuss this without acknowledging the incredibly racial disparity in the directing nominees as well. Yes, it's a story that has a lot of traction, but with the recent history made with Jane Campion, it feels important to tell now. 

In recent years, a greater recognition of gender and racial equality in Hollywood has been pushed. There was the #MeToo movement that loomed over the 2018 Oscars, and the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag that began in 2015 and is revived every so often when nominations are announced. And this is not to say strides have not been made - _Parasite_ won the big prizes in 2020, and films written and directed by women like _Promising Young Woman (2020)_ and _Little Women (2019)_ have been significantly nominated for Best Picture or Screenplay. 

When it comes to directors, however, change has not been as quick. **Only 7 women have been *nominated* for Best Director in the 94 years of the Academy Awards**. There have been 2 wins, the second happening only last year in 2020. 2020 was the first year in Oscar history that more than 1 woman was nominated in the Best Director category. 

Similarly, only **6 Black directors have been nominated in 94 years, none of them women, and none of them winning.** 

The exclusion of women from the Best Director category also has ties to those movies that win for Best Picture - of the 93 films that have won Best Picture, 67 have won Best Director as well. That's a 72% win relationship between director and Best Picture. Interestingly enough, **18** women-directed films have garnered a Best Picture nomination - with only **8** getting nominated (2 of those being Jane Campion), that ratio drops to 44%.

### The Sketches

I also started messing around in Canva and made something I think I want to use in my final project...but it felt right to put it here, too, to show the kind of visualization style I'm trying to go for!

I'm still trying to figure out ways to visualize a lot of this data in non-pie chart fashions, which is why my sketches are a bit bare - but I have the data, and I know my storyline, so now I can figure out the most engaging ways to share it!


### The Method 
I'm interested in using Shorthand for this project - I feel like having one cohesive website that can also be used as a deliverable for spreading this information is a good choice for this topic! In terms of how I'll be creating my visualizations, I anticipate it being a combination of Tableau and programs like Canva - a lot of this information can be very simply portrayed, and some of it will require the more complex functions of Tableau!
