As someone passionate about the environment, and subsequently decreasing meat consumption, I found two separate graphs depicting both the Global Meat Consumption of various meat types frmo 1990 to 2020 and the Global Meat Substitute Consumption (and projection) from 2013 to 2026. Screenshots of the files are below.

Not only did I want to combine these visualizations into one graph, but I did not enjoy how the Global Meat Consumption graph visualized each type's growth. It was confusing, hard to read, and didn't tell a clear story. 

#### **My Redesigns**
I created my sketches *BEFORE* translating the two data sets into the same set of the same scale - this is important information when it comes to my process. I wanted to put both sets of data on the same graph, either showing change over time - and thus the steady recent growth of meat substitutes - or the proportion of the market each holds. Because I did not know conversion yet from kilograms (original units of the Meat Substitute data) to tons (original units of Global Meat Consumption data), my sketches ended up not looking like my final product. Even then, they helped me figure out which graph type might be best for this project.

With both the line chart and the pie chart, I anticipated the meat substitutes to be...well, a much more significant aspect. When I created my new data set and converted the data to the same units, however, the drafts started looking a bit grim. 

It was at this point that my story changed - instead of showing the impressive growth of meat substitues that I anticipated, the story the data was telling was now "If you thought meatless eating was a huge new trend, it's actually not making a dent."

The feedback from my interviews basically confirmed that: that the meat substitute data was incredibly small, but that it still told a story. Since this was now my focus, I changed the meat substitute color to green and the rest to neutrals and pinks - the green will catch your eye, even if it's a tiny part of the graph. I ended up finishing this assignment with two graphs - they tell similar stories, but in different ways. 

The line graph shows the change over time - the meat substitute data only starts in 2013 and then projects to 2026, so thanks to user feedback I added a line demarcating the present day (in this case, 2020, as that is when the meat data ends). There was an alternative version of this graph that used logarithmic units - it showed a more impressive change over time for the meat substitutes, but also seemed a bit misleading, so I stuck with the original raw units. 

The circle chart shows not the change or growth, but the relative size of the market of each meat in any given year. On the right, the user can select their year - it'll default to 2020, the most recent, but clicking through different years can show gradual changes, if even in a less obvious way than the line graph. 

One graph shows growth - and is still interesting regardless of how small the meat substitute data is. The other shows these meat types in comparison to each other, showing the behemoth that is animal meat consumption versus what people assume to be a "booming" industry of meat substitutes.
